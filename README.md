# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. The objective of this project is to identify patterns and key factors contributing to churn and build a predictive model that helps businesses take proactive measures to retain customers.

Problem Statement

Customer retention is critical for sustaining business growth. Acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, businesses can target them with personalized retention strategies. This project aims to build a model that predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on historical customer data.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various customer attributes such as demographics, account information, services subscribed, and usage statistics. It includes both churned and retained customers.

Key Features:

Customer demographics (age, gender, etc.)

Account details (tenure, contract type, monthly charges, total charges)

Service information (internet service, phone service, streaming services)

Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Approach

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling numerical features

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding distributions and correlations

Identifying important factors influencing churn

Visualizing churn patterns across customer segments

Model Building

Implemented and compared multiple models including:

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Used evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Model Evaluation

Compared model performance to select the most effective one

Interpreted model outputs to understand key churn drivers

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Results

Achieved high accuracy and balanced performance across precision and recall.

Identified key factors such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges as major contributors to churn.

The XGBoost model provided the best overall performance.

Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict customer churn and provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies. The insights derived from the analysis can guide businesses to improve customer satisfaction and reduce attrition rates.

Future Work

Implement deep learning models for further improvement.

Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.

Integrate additional behavioral and transactional data for higher accuracy.
